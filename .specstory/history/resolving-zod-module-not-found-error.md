## Resolving Zod Module Not Found Error (09/11/2024, 15:04:54)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Não é possível localizar o módulo 'zod' ou suas declarações de tipo correspondentes.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error is in Portuguese and means "Cannot find module 'zod' or its corresponding type declarations."

To fix this, you need to install the `zod` package. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install zod
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn add zod
```

This will install the package and add it to your `package.json` dependencies, resolving the import error.
